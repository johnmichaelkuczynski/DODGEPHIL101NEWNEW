    "Describe one original thought experiment in which an individual's senses mislead them, similar to Plato's prisoners in the cave. Identify the \"shadows,\" the \"fire,\" and the \"outside world\" in your example, and explain how it supports or challenges Plato's point.",

    "Provide a case in which two people reach opposite moral conclusions while reasoning correctly from the same ethical theory taught in the course. Explain how this is possible without either person being \"wrong.\"",
