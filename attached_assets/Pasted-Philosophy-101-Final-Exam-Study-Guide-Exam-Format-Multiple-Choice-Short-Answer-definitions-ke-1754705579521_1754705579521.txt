Recognize the concept of knowledge as “justified true belief” (JTB) as presented in the course

WEEK 2 – Truth, Lying, and Skepticism
You must be able to:

Explain the course’s account of truth-telling and lying

State Kant’s view on lying as presented in class/text

Define “bullshit” per the assigned reading and show how it differs from lying

Define skepticism and summarize Descartes’ method of doubt from the course

WEEK 3 – Knowledge and Gettier Problems
You must be able to:

State the JTB definition of knowledge

Explain what a Gettier problem is and why it matters

Recall at least one Gettier case from the course

Explain why Gettier cases challenge JTB

WEEK 4 – Mind-Body Dualism & Divine Command Theory
You must be able to:

Define mind-body dualism as presented in the course

Give one course-based reason for dualism and one course-based objection

Define Divine Command Theory

Explain the Euthyphro Dilemma and why it is a challenge to Divine Command Theory

WEEK 5 – Ethics and Moral Philosophy
You must be able to:

Define the Problem of Evil

Differentiate between the form(s) of the problem discussed in class (logical, evidential if covered)

Summarize any responses covered in the text (e.g., free will defense)

Identify basic course-level principles of moral responsibility

WEEK 6 – Moral Responsibility & Course Synthesis
You must be able to:

Define free will, determinism, and compatibilism as presented in the course

Explain how these relate to moral responsibility

Apply these concepts to straightforward examples

POSSIBLE FINAL EXAM ESSAY QUESTIONS
(Two or three will appear; you will write on one or two.)

Construct a new Gettier-style example (not covered in class) that challenges the “justified true belief” definition of knowledge. Explain why it satisfies all three JTB conditions and yet still fails to be knowledge.

Using only course definitions, explain the Euthyphro Dilemma and show how each horn of the dilemma creates a problem for Divine Command Theory. Give one possible reply to the dilemma and assess whether it succeeds.

Present a case where a person could not have done otherwise but still seems morally responsible for their action. Explain how this example relates to compatibilism as presented in the course.

Describe one original thought experiment in which an individual’s senses mislead them, similar to Plato’s prisoners in the cave. Identify the “shadows,” the “fire,” and the “outside world” in your example, and explain how it supports or challenges Plato’s point.

Define skepticism as covered in the course and present one argument for skepticism and one argument against it. Explain which argument is stronger, using course concepts.

Using a case of moral decision-making, show how lying could be justified or condemned under the moral theory assigned in the course (e.g., Kant’s ethics). Clearly apply the theory’s principles to your example.

Describe an example in which the Problem of Evil arises. Apply one of the responses to the problem covered in the course (e.g., the free will defense) and evaluate whether the response solves the problem in your example.

Provide a case in which two people reach opposite moral conclusions while reasoning correctly from the same ethical theory taught in the course. Explain how this is possible without either person being “wrong.”

Present a hypothetical in which a person holds a true belief that happens to be correct by accident. Explain why this belief fails to qualify as knowledge according to the course definition, and show how it resembles or differs from a Gettier case.

Invent a simple story illustrating mind-body dualism. Identify how the events in your story support the claim that the mind and body are distinct, and describe one objection to dualism that could be raised against your story.
