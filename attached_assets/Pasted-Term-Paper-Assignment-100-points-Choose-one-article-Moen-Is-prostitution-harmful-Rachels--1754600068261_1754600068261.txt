Model Response:
 The Inherent Harm of Commodifying Intimacy

 Introduction
Ole Martin Moen argues prostitution isn't inherently harmful. This paper examines his response to the "commodification of intimacy" objection, demonstrating that his analysis overlooks key psychological harms inherent to commercializing intimate acts.

 Argument Summary
Moen addresses nine arguments against prostitution, including that it commodifies intimacy. He claims this isn't harmful since: 
1. Many intimate acts are already commodified (massage, therapy)
2. Commodification doesn't necessarily degrade intimacy
3. Participants can separate commercial from personal intimacy

He concludes commodification concerns don't demonstrate prostitution's inherent harmfulness.

 Critical Objection
Moen's analysis ignores psychological evidence about intimacy's role in human wellbeing. Unlike massage or therapy, sexual intimacy involves unique neurochemical responses (oxytocin, dopamine) that create emotional bonding. Repeatedly subverting these natural responses through commercial sex likely causes psychological harm by:
1. Disrupting normal bonding mechanisms
2. Creating cognitive dissonance between physical and emotional intimacy
3. Potentially impairing capacity for genuine intimate relationships

 Critical Response
One might defend Moen by arguing these psychological effects aren't universal or that individuals can develop healthy coping mechanisms. However, this merely shows some people might avoid harm, not that the practice isn't inherently harmful. A better approach would be:
1. Acknowledging inherent psychological risks
2. Developing harm reduction strategies
3. Supporting alternative income sources
4. Treating prostitution as hazardous work requiring safeguards

 Conclusion
While Moen's broader argument against prohibition has merit, his dismissal of commodification concerns overlooks significant psychological evidence. Effective policy requires acknowledging prostitution's inherent risks while working to minimize harm.
