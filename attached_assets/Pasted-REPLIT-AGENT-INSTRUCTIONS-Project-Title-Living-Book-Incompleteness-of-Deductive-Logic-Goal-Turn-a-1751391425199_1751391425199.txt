REPLIT AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
Project Title: Living Book: Incompleteness of Deductive Logic
Goal: Turn a fixed academic paper into a fully interactive, AI-augmented interface (not a general-purpose upload app).

🔒 CORE REQUIREMENTS
This app is for one specific text only. There is no upload feature. Do not allow the user to load their own document.

📘 TEXT DISPLAY
Preload the academic paper: Incompleteness of Deductive Logic for Publication.pdf (convert to clean HTML on backend or pre-rendered if needed).

Display it as a scrollable, well-formatted document.

Render all math using KaTeX or MathJax.

Create auto-linked headers (like: Abstract, Section 1, 2, etc.) for navigation.

🧠 INSTRUCTION BOX (PASSTHROUGH INTERFACE)
Add a large instruction box with this placeholder:

“Ask a question, give a command, or modify the content (e.g., ‘rewrite section 3.2 as a dialogue’, ‘summarize the proofs’, or ‘explain it like I’m 15’)”

Upon submission, send:

Full text of the paper (or vector-based document context)

The instruction

To the selected LLM

🔁 LLM MODEL SWITCHER
Add model selector dropdown:

Default: DeepSeek

Also support: OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity

Let the user switch models mid-session.

💬 AI CHAT INTERFACE
Add chat UI at the bottom.

Must:

Know the paper

Let the user ask anything about it

Let the user issue general queries (e.g., “How does this relate to Gödel’s first theorem?”)

Support Markdown + KaTeX

All messages must be passed without LLM filtering

📤 OUTPUT CONTROLS
Below each AI response, include buttons:

Download as PDF (with math)

Email this response to me (via SendGrid)

Copy to clipboard

Ensure PDF output preserves layout and renders perfect LaTeX math (no fake Word-style formulas).

⚙️ TECHNICAL DETAILS
Backend: Flask or Node.js

Math: Use KaTeX or MathJax for browser + PDF export

PDF rendering: Use Puppeteer or similar to preserve KaTeX

Email via SendGrid API (user provides address)

Optional: vector chunking + embedding per section (for better LLM memory)

❌ DO NOT INCLUDE
File upload field

Dropdowns like “Convert to dialogue” — all instructions must be freeform

Any label that calls this a “philosophy paper”
