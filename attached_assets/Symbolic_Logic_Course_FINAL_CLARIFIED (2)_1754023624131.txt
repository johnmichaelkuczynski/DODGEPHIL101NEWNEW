ZHI SYSTEMS — SYMBOLIC LOGIC COURSE APP (CLONE VERSION)

THIS APP IS A CLONE OF THE SYMBOLIC LOGIC LIVING BOOK, BUT THE COURSE PART IS ENTIRELY SEPARATE.

⚠️ READ THIS CAREFULLY:

YOU ARE BUILDING A NEW APP THAT CONTAINS TWO SYSTEMS IN PARALLEL:

1. THE ORIGINAL SYMBOLIC LOGIC LIVING BOOK
2. A FULL UNIVERSITY-LEVEL COURSE BUILT AROUND IT

THE LIVING BOOK IS ONE TAB. EXACTLY ONE TAB. ITS UI AND LOGIC **DO NOT CARRY OVER** INTO THE REST OF THE APP. DO NOT MERGE THEM.

——————————————————————————
TAB STRUCTURE:

TAB 1: "Living Book"
- This tab is an exact clone of the Symbolic Logic Living Book app.
- Must preserve 100% of the original features:
  - Rewrite
  - Study Guide
  - Podcast
  - Ask-the-Book
- DO NOT modify, extract, repackage, or re-integrate this logic into the course system.
- This is the original Living Book, contained within one tab only.

TAB 2: "Syllabus"
- A separate, functional course syllabus
- Shows week-by-week schedule with:
  - Topic (clickable)
  - Linked Living Book section (opens Tab 1)
  - Due assignments with real-time status:
    ✅ Completed
    ❗ Overdue
    ⏳ Not Yet Due

TAB 3: "Modules"
- One module per week (Week 1–6, Midterm, Final)
- Each module contains:
  - LLM-generated lecture summary
  - Link to correct Living Book section (opens Tab 1)
  - Graded Homework (LLM-generated, GPTZero-enforced, timed)
  - Graded Quiz or Test (if applicable)

TAB 4: "Practice Center"
- User can generate unlimited practice versions of:
  - Homework
  - Tests
  - Midterm
  - Final
- Practice items are not scored, saved, or limited

TAB 5: "My Grades"

——————————————————————————
NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:

1. DO NOT BLEND THE LIVING BOOK UI OR CODE INTO COURSE TABS.
2. DO NOT REUSE ITS FUNCTIONALITY OUTSIDE OF TAB 1.
3. DO NOT HARD-CODE QUESTIONS, ANSWERS, OR GRADING RULES.
4. DO NOT USE IN-CODE GRADING LOGIC. THE LLM MUST DO ALL GRADING.
5. DO NOT GENERATE STATIC ASSIGNMENTS OR LECTURES.

ALL COURSE CONTENT (homeworks, tests, lectures, practice) MUST BE GENERATED DYNAMICALLY BY THE LLM, IN REAL TIME.

GPTZERO is used for detection only. GPTZero score > 50% = auto-zero. No exceptions.

——————————————————————————
SUMMARY:

- Tab 1 is a pure Living Book clone. Do not touch or modify.
- Tabs 2–5 are a new course layer. They must remain logically, visually, and functionally distinct from the book.
- Nothing from the book carries into the course tabs except for clickable links to sections.

THIS IS THE FINAL, IMPLEMENTATION-READY SPEC.
