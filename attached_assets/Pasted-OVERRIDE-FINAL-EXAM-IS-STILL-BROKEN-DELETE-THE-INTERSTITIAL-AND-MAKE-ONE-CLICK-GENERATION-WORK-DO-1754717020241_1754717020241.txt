OVERRIDE. FINAL EXAM IS STILL BROKEN. DELETE THE INTERSTITIAL AND MAKE ONE-CLICK GENERATION WORK. DO NOT MARK DONE UNTIL YOU PROVIDE A 20-SECOND SCREEN RECORDING SHOWING THE FLOW.

0) Remove the interstitial entirely
Delete the component that renders the Final Exam inside any Modal/Sheet/Dialog/Overlay/Drawer.

Delete any “container” component that mounts the exam view in a lightbox layered over the modules page.

Remove all imports/usages of Modal/Sheet/Dialog for the Final Exam flow.

The Final Exam must render as a plain, full page view.

1) Route must be a full page
Final Exam lives at its own route (e.g., /final-exam or whatever you already created).

Navigating to that route must never open a modal; it must show a full page with one button centered: Generate Final Exam.

No other CTAs on that page.

2) Button click must fire exactly one request
Ensure the button is not inside a <form>.

Ensure there is only one click handler bound to it. Remove all others.

Ensure no overlay or parent has pointer-events blocking clicks.

On click: disable button, show inline text “Generating exam…”, call the single exam generation endpoint.

3) No second step, no extra button, no modal
The generation must happen immediately after the single click.

Do not show a second “Generate” button anywhere.

Do not navigate to another interstitial.

Do not show alerts/popups. Errors must render inline on this page and re-enable the button.

4) Endpoint behavior
Timeout ≥ 120s.

429/503 → retry once after 1.5s.

On success: render the exam on the same page (MC/SA/Essay).

On failure: inline message with the real reason; button re-enabled.

5) Persistence per attempt
Freeze the generated set for the attempt; page refresh shows the same set.

After submit/cancel, show Generate New Exam (creates a brand-new set). That control must not appear before.

6) Acceptance checklist (must all be TRUE)
 No Modal/Sheet/Dialog/Overlay anywhere in Final Exam flow (files removed).

 Final Exam is a full page with one button only.

 One click → inline “Generating exam…” → exam renders on that page.

 No second “generate” button appears.

 No popups; errors are inline and actionable.

 Refresh mid-attempt preserves the same exam.

 After completion, “Generate New Exam” appears and creates a different set.

7) Proof required
Provide a screen recording showing:

Visiting the Final Exam route (full page, one button).

Single click → inline loader → exam appears.

Simulated failure (temporarily break the key), showing inline error and re-enabled button.

Refresh preserving the attempt.

Completion and “Generate New Exam” producing a new set.

Also paste the list of deleted files (all modal/overlay components that were previously wrapping the exam).

8) Emergency fallback (if button still fails after 30 minutes)
Temporarily auto-generate on page load (no button) so the exam appears immediately when the route opens.

Keep this only as a temporary measure; then restore the single-button flow once fixed.

Do not claim completion until the video and deleted-file list are provided and every checklist item is verified.
