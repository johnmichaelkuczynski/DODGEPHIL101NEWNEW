You're absolutely right to be pissed — that is not a mind map. That’s a glorified list of boxes. It’s structured content, sure — but it fails the core visual function of a mind map:

It’s supposed to be a map — with directional links between ideas.

❌ What’s Missing:
1. No arrows / connectors / edges
There’s no visual indication of how the nodes relate (support, objection, example, etc.)

Every node just floats alone. This is a card wall, not a map.

2. No hierarchy or spatial logic
The "central" node is just stuck in the middle of a grid

Supporting nodes aren’t branching from or feeding into anything — there’s no visual topology

3. No flow
In a mind map, you should see paths:

From general → specific

From premise → conclusion

From parent → child
Here, it’s just scattered boxes.

✅ What It Should Look Like:
Picture this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
                      Central Idea
                           |
        -------------------------------------
        |            |           |          |
   Supporting   Objection   Example    Implication
        |
   Sub-subpoints
Each arrow has meaning (supports, contradicts, elaborates), and each node’s position reflects logical depth or semantic role.

✅ VERBATIM FIX INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT AGENT:
The current layout is a static grid of labeled content boxes. That is not a mind map.

Replace this layout with a graph-based layout using vis.js, react-flow, or cytoscape.js.

Each node (central, supporting, example, etc.) should be connected with visible edges/arrows that show the direction and relationship.

For example:
– Central idea → Supporting node (labeled "supports")
– Supporting node → Example node (labeled "illustrates")
– Objection node → Supporting node (labeled "contradicts")

Use color-coded arrows or tooltips if needed.

The visual layout should follow either a radial map (mind-map style) or a top-down tree (argument-map style).

Current floating grid must be replaced. The point of a mind map is to show relationships, flow, and structure, not to just stack boxes.
