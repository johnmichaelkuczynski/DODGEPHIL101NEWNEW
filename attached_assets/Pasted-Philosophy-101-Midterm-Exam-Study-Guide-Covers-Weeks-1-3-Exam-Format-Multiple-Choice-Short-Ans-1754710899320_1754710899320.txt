WEEK 1 – Introduction to Philosophy & Epistemology
You must be able to:

Define the five main branches of philosophy: epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, logic, aesthetics

Explain Plato’s Allegory of the Cave:

Outline the story as told in the course

Identify what the shadows, fire, and outside world represent

State its main point about the difference between appearance and reality

Define knowledge as presented in the course (“justified true belief” – JTB)

WEEK 2 – Truth, Lying, and Skepticism
You must be able to:

State the course’s definitions of truth-telling and lying

Explain Kant’s position on lying as presented in the course

Define “bullshit” from the assigned reading and explain how it differs from lying

Define skepticism in the course’s terms

Summarize Descartes’ method of doubt from the text

WEEK 3 – Knowledge and Gettier Problems
You must be able to:

State the JTB definition of knowledge

Explain what a Gettier problem is and why it challenges JTB

Recall at least one Gettier example from the course

Explain why that example meets all JTB conditions but still fails to count as knowledge

POSSIBLE MIDTERM ESSAY QUESTIONS
(Two or three will appear; you will write on one or two.)

Construct a new Gettier-style example (not from the course) that challenges the JTB definition of knowledge. Explain why it meets all three JTB conditions and yet fails to be knowledge.

Define skepticism as covered in the course and present one argument for skepticism and one argument against it. Explain which is stronger, using only course concepts.

Describe an original example, parallel to Plato’s Cave, in which a person mistakes appearance for reality. Identify what in your example corresponds to the shadows, the fire, and the outside world, and explain the lesson it teaches.

Present a case in which a person holds a belief that is true by accident. Explain why it fails to be knowledge under the course definition, and compare it to a Gettier case.

Using only the moral theory on lying taught in the course, analyze a case where lying might seem justified. Show whether, under the theory, the lie is morally right or wrong.

Explain Descartes’ method of doubt as given in the course. Provide a modern example of how this method could be applied to question an everyday belief.

Identify a case in which skepticism would prevent someone from claiming to know something important. Explain how the course material suggests responding to that skeptical challenge.

Present a short scenario in which a person is justified in believing something false. Explain why, under JTB, this does not count as knowledge, and how Gettier cases are similar or different.

Create a simple analogy that explains the point of Plato’s Allegory of the Cave to someone unfamiliar with philosophy. Make sure the analogy preserves the key parts of the story.

Explain how “bullshit,” as defined in the assigned reading, differs from lying. Give an example of each from everyday life, and explain why the distinction matters for truth-seeking.
