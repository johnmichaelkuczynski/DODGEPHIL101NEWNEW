=== Logic and Language ===
1. Algorithm: A fixed procedure for carrying out a task. The rules that we learn in grade school to multiply, add, etc., multi-digit numbers are algorithms. By formalizing inferences, logicians create al...

2. Axiomatization: To axiomatize a discipline is to identify a small number of propositions and a small number of inference-rules such that all of the results of that discipline follow from those proposi...

3. Causal inference: An inference based on knowledge of a causal law (e.g., I see smoke; I know that there is smoke only if there is fire; so I infer that there is, or was, a fire)....


=== Truth and Meaning ===
1. Ambiguity vs. indexicality: An ambiguous expression is one that is assigned meaning by two or more different rules. So “dumb” is ambiguous, since there...

3. The standard way of abbreviating (5) is: (7) For any x, ‹x is identical with› is true. Quasi-quotes will occur frequently in the chapters on the philosophy of language. It’s not always easy to know wh...

1. Axiom: A statement that, in some context, is assumed to be true and therefore isn’t argued for....

2. Axiom (second definition): A statement-form that, in some context, is assumed to have a true interpretation. See “interpretation.”...

3. The axiom of comprehension: This is the principle that, given any property, there is a set containing all and only those objects that have that property. There is a set containing all and only those t...


=== Ethics and Values ===
